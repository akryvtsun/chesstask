### Chess Problem ### 
The problem is to find all distinct layouts of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions MÃ—N 
where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Assume the colour of the piece does not matter, 
and that there are no pawns among the pieces.
Write a program which takes as input:
- The dimensions of the board: M, N.
- The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.
As output, the program should yield the number of distinct layouts for which all of the pieces can be placed on the 
board without threatening each other. 
Please find the total number of unique configurations for a 6x9 board with 2 Kings, 1 Queen, 1 Bishop, 1 Rook and 
1 Knight.

You should be able to complete this task using no more than 500 lines of code, possibly much less. If you find yourself 
going beyond this limit you are almost certainly taking the wrong approach.
One solution in Python took 20 minutes to run; for the purpose of this test that is perfectly acceptable.
Solution will need to be able to run on a notebook having 4G RAM.
